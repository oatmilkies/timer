/*
A timer which behaves in the following way:

* The user can press b and it should beep right away
* The user can input any number from 1 to 9 and it should immediately output "setting timer for x seconds...", and beep after that number of seconds has passed
* The user can use ctrl + c to exit the program, at which point the program
* should say "Thanks for using me, ciao!" before terminating
